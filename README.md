# Skytunes: Activity based playlist suggestions

Sky Tunes is a simple app built on the MERN (Mongo, Express, React-Redux, Node) stack. The app takes the user's current activity as input and lazily "mines" Spotify's top playlists archived under the given activity. The final output is a custom "mined" playlist accessible from the web app. Skytunes also features a "now playing" module displaying the currently playing track and controls for play/pause, skip, and back.

## Purpose:
Have some fun with the Spotify Api while getting more familiar with the MERN stack.
